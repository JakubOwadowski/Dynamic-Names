Source for the mod [Dynamic Names Redux](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3512012035)

To generate the mod according to the rules in generator/rules/rules.txt, run main.py with your favourite Python distribution. It will overwrite the original mod.

NOTE: This requires the [ANTLR Python Runtime](https://pypi.org/project/antlr4-python3-runtime/), which can be installed with `pip install antlr4-python3-runtime`. On certain operating systems, you may need to set up a virtual environment in order to do this.
